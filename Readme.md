I wanted to see if SpriteKit could be used for something besides games.
My Teenage Engineering OP-1 synth has an interesting "tombola" mode, where balls are dropped into a spinning hexagon.
When the balls hit each other or the walls of the hexagon, notes are played.

A video explains it better:

Here's a video of the SpriteKit version:
